[pageantty] provides utility libraries for running pagers in the
terminal.

It includes [Git_pager], a small one-module library for displaying
Git diffs and other custom outputs in a terminal pager.

This is useful for tools that integrate with Git and need to display
output exceeding one screen, while respecting user color preferences
and Git's configuration.
